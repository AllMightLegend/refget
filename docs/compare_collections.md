# How to: Compare two collections

## Use case

- You have a local sequence collection, and an identifier for a collection in a server. You want to compare the two to see if they have the same coordinate system.
- You have two identifiers for collections you know are stored by a server. You want to compare them.


## How to do it

You can use the `/comparison/:digest1/:digest2` endpoint to compare two collections. The comparison function gives information-rich feedback about the two collections, but it can take some thought to interpret. Here are some examples

### Strict identity

If you're looking to ensure that the two sequence collections are *strictly identical* -- that is, they have the same sequence content, with the same names, in the same order... then you actually don't need the `/comparison` endpoint; **two collections will have the same digest if they are identicial in content and order for all `inherent` attributes.** Therefore, if the digests differ, then you know the collections differ in at least one inherent attribute.

If you have a local sequence collection, and an identifier, then you can compare them for strict identity by computing the identifier for the local collection and seeing if they match.

### Order-relaxed identity

A process that treats each sequence independently and re-orders its results will return identical results as long as the sequence content and names are identical, even if the order doesnâ€™t match. Therefore, you may be interested in saying "these two sequence collections have identical content and sequence names, but differ in order". The `/comparison` return value can answer this question:

Two collections meet the criteria for order-relaxed identity if:

1. the value of the `elements.total.a` and `elements.total.b` match, (the collections have the same number of elements).
2. this value is the same as `elements.a-and-b.<attribute>` for all attributes (the content is the same)
3. all entries in `elements.a-and-b-same-order.<attribute>` are false (the order differs for all attributes)

### Others...

There are many other types of compatibilty you can assess using the result of the `/comparison` function, which will be documented later.
