# Architectural Decision Record

## 2021-01-20 - Use the SAM specification v1 description of sequence names

### Decision

Sequence collections will use the [v1 SAM specification (subsection 1.2.1)](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf#subsubsection.1.2.1) to define the allowable characters in a sequence name. As of January 2021, this is:

> Reference sequence names may contain any printable ASCII characters in the range[!-~]apart from backslashes, commas, quotation marks, and brackets—i.e., apart from ‘\ , "‘’ () [] {} <>’—and may notstart with ‘*’ or ‘=’.4

Should a wider GA4GH standard appear from [TASC issue 5](https://github.com/ga4gh/TASC/issues/5) the sequence collection spec will review this decision. The long-term vision of the sequence collections specification is to comply with any eventual GA4GH standard for sequence names.

### Known limitations

- There have been a handful of reports of old sequences with "weird stuff" in the seqeuence name rows (`>`) of FASTA files, particularly from the microbiome community. These sequence collections would have to be changed to include only SAM-compatible ASCII characters, which could restrict usage of the sequence collections protocols and delay uptake.
